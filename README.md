                                                                                ## Image Editor

I created a image editor app using react and electron, including basic functionalities having few filters and buttons to rotate left and rotate right. I included a save button to download the edited image and a gallery view button to view the saved images in a particular folder.
For the gallery window I created a child window of the parent window. The whole app is made out of trial and error. The gllery window has a next and previous buttons to navigate through the saved pictures.
